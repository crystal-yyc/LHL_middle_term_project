This repository consists of following files:

- **exploratory_analysis.ipynb**:  EDA Process 
- **multi_class_modeling.ipynb**: Predict flight delay type
- **cancellation_non_cancellation binary classification modeling
- ** regression modeling to predict the arrive delay time 
- **data_description.md**:data information
- **test_data_submission.csv**: submission of the predicted delay data for the unknown flights  
### Data

The data are from air travel industry,and have four separate tables:

1. **flights**: The departure and arrival information about flights in US in years 2018 and 2019.
2. **fuel_comsumption**: The fuel comsumption of different airlines from years 2015-2019 aggregated per month.
3. **passengers**: The passenger totals on different routes from years 2015-2019 aggregated per month.
5. **flights_test**: The departure and arrival information about flights in US in January 2020. This table will be used for evaluation. We are required to predict delays on flights from first 7 days of 2020 (1st of January - 7th of January). We can find sample submission in file _sample_submission.csv_
